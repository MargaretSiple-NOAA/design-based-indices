\usage{
calc_alk(
  gapdata = NULL,
  racebase_tables = lifecycle::deprecated(),
  unsex = c("all", "unsex")[2],
  global = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gapdata}{data object created from \code{gapindex::get_data()}}

\item{racebase_tables}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Use the
\code{gapdata} argument instead.}

\item{unsex}{string, option to determine how unsexed individuals are
treated. Option "all" means that unsexed alks are determined
by combining all sexes (males, females, and unsexed) and is
the option used for standard design-based composition
production. Option "unsex" means that unsexed alk are only
determined by unsexed individuals and is the option used for
creating data inputs for model-based age composition indices.
Defaults to "unsex"}

\item{global}{boolean. Should missing length bins be filled by using an
alk consisting of all years? Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
dataframe of probabilities ("AGE_FRAC") of ages ("AGE") by length
(LENGTH_MM) for a given survey ("SURVEY"), year ("YEAR"), species
(SPECIES_CODE), and sex (SEX).
}
\description{
Calculates empircal probability of age at length from collected otolith data.
